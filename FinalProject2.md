## User Research

### Research Protocol

#### a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story

The purpose of my presentation is to demonstrate whether an electric vehicle, either BEV or PHEV, is an good option while considering purchsing a vehicle.

Based on the intention of my presentation, the ideal target audience would be people who are considering buying a vehicle.

#### b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

Since my target audience is potential vehicle buyers, I've identified the following individuals as representatives

1. People who has a driving liscense but do not have a vehicle yet.
These people have few knowledge about the things to consider since they have not gone through the vehicle purchasing process. I would like to see how my presentation can affect they decisions.

2. People who have a vehicle.
These people have already gone through the vehicle purchasing process and have insights of key aspects of driving a vehicle. I would like to see how my presentation can affect their decisions combined with all their existing knowledge.

#### c. your interview script

1. What do you think is this website used for?
2. Who might be the target audience of this website?
3. Do you think these information on the website can help you make the decision?
4. Any missing contents you are looking for while making your decisions?
5. What do you feel confusing of find missing for making decisions?
6. Anything you would change to make this website a better one?

#### d. the findings from your interviews
