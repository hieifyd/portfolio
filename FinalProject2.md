## First draft of the presentation
I combined all the wireframes and storyboards to create my first version of the presentation. Using all those materials, I created a presentation, including visualizations, on Shorthand for user research.

Below is the link for my first draft.:

## User Research

### Research Protocol

#### a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story

The purpose of my presentation is to demonstrate whether an electric vehicle, either BEV or PHEV, is a good option while considering purchasing a vehicle.

Based on the intention of my presentation, the ideal target audience would be people who are considering buying a vehicle.

#### b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

Since my target audience is potential vehicle buyers, I've identified the following individuals as representatives

1. People who have a driving license but do not have a vehicle yet.
These people have little knowledge about the things to consider since they have not gone through the vehicle purchasing process. I would like to see how my presentation can affect their decisions.

2. People who have a vehicle.
These people have already gone through the vehicle purchasing process and have insights into key aspects of driving a vehicle. I would like to see how my presentation can affect their decisions combined with all their existing knowledge.

#### c. your interview script

1. What do you think is this website used for?
2. Who might be the target audience of this website?
3. Do you think this information on the website can help you make the decision?
4. Any missing contents you are looking for while making your decisions?
5. What do you feel confusing of find missing for making decisions?
6. Anything you would change to make this website a better one?

#### d. the findings from your interviews
Below are the responses from three interviewees:

**Interviewee One:**

*1. What do you think is this website used for?*

This is a general introduction about what EV is and how EV performs compared to traditional vehicles.

This website shared some concerns, or obvious cons, about EV.

*2. Who might be the target audience of this website?*

This is not a website target at selling EV to potential customers. It’s more about a website that provides detailed information. So, the target audience should be people who are interested in EV and EV industry, not people who are considering buying an EV.

*3. Do you think this information on the website can help you make the decision?*

No. Because as a potential customer, I’ve already known that range anxiety and price are the two major defects of EV compared to traditional vehicles.

*4. Any missing contents you are looking for while making your decisions?*

Whether should we buy it. Electric range and price are already in thoughts. No additional information is given in this process.

*5. What do you feel confusing about this website.*

Benchmark between two vehicles. Item by item comparison.

Detailed benefits (pros, cons, quantitatively) between ICV and EV of a similar price.

Financing. Whether customers can get loans or post services.

*6. Anything you would change to make this website a better one?*

Introduce what’s the difference between EV and others. For normal customers

Recommend a couple of attributes of EV, such as MPG, and provided links for interviewers

Quiz for whether a potential customer is suitable for EV such as range, house size.

**Interviewee Two**

*1. What do you think is this website used for?*

Explains the reasons why people do not purchase EVs and provides details and people’s concerns. There is a number of data that talk about the cons of buying an EV.

*2. Who might be the target audience of this website?*

Industry analyst, especially those in the vehicle industry. Analysts in the stock market can also be the target audience.

*3. Do you think this information on the website can help you make the decision?*

Yes. This website demonstrates the major concerns which are price and electric range. 

However, the chart about geo distributions of EV owners doesn’t help with the decision-making process. It’s obvious that big cities will always have more EV owners. This chart only proves some concepts that people already are aware of.

*4. Any missing contents you are looking for while making your decisions?*

Information about EV usage. The charging station, such as the map of supercharging, price of electricity usage, oil saving compared to using a traditional vehicle, price of installing charging stations, etc

*5. What do you feel confusing about this website.?*

The chart about the electric range is too complicated to understand at first sight.

In the price chart, Volt and model x have similar color, which is hard to distinguish

Do not know what ICV stands for.

*6. Anything you would change to make this website a better one?*

Present a summary at the beginning

Add some metrics to help consumers make the decision

**Interviewee Three**

*1. What do you think is this website used for?*

I’m confused. Maybe a presentation to the author’s boss in a consulting firm to report the current status of the EV industry.

This website can also be used For EV industry market research. It could also be a website to see how this industry performs and locate potential users.

*2. Who might be the target audience of this website?*

Maybe the author’s boss in a consulting firm, or the client of the author.

It could also be used by media companies like Bloomberg as news presses.

*3. Do you think this information on the website can help you make the decision?*

Not enough. Information is too little.

*4. Any missing contents you are looking for while making your decisions?*

The contents of EV’s popularity and population provide little help in the decision-making process. Also, the geo-distribution of EV in the Washington State is not relevant either.

What potential buyers really care about are those concerns. Price is the biggest concern of a potential buyer. Meanwhile, I would like to know if there is any way to address the price issues, like providing financing?

The chart of the electric range can relieve my concerns on range anxiety.

I would like to see more comparison between EV and ICV in a variety of fields such as specifications, price, brand, etc.

In the recommendations part, we can apply use cases to illustrate this point.

*5. What do you feel confusing about this website.?*

I’m a bit confused about the major intention of this website. Is this website used to persuade people to buy EVs? Or is it just an introduction material to provide object opinions?

In the beginning, the website says that EV is good. However, the latter part said negative things about EV. It’s confusing.

It’s hard to tell the conclusion of the price chart.

*6. Anything you would change to make this website a better one?*

I would like to see more comparisons on the life-time expense of EVs and traditional vehicles.
The chart at the beginning looks like marking materials. However, charts in the main contents do not look as good as the first several ones. Should put more effort into data visualization.


#### e. changes you implemented to your sketches, storyboards, and wireframes to address the issues identified
Based on feedback from interviewees, I've identified the following issues and would like to make corresponding modifications:

Issues: The intention of the website is unclear.

Solution: Add a summary part at the beginning of the website. Re-organize storyboard to satisfy key concepts of the website

Issues: Want to see more comparison between EV and traditional vehicles.

Solution: Add a section in people's concern part talking about differences in the filed of specification, usage, etc.

Issues: Charts need to be improved

Solution: Further polish data visualization according to specific usage.
