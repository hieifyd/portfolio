## User Research

### Research Protocol

#### a. the target audience you hope to reach with your story

The purpose of my presentation is to demonstrate whether an electric vehicle, either BEV or PHEV, is an good option while considering purchsing a vehicle.

Based on the intention of my presentation, the ideal target audience would be people who are considering buying a vehicle.

#### b. your approach to identifying representative individuals to interview

Since my target audience is potential vehicle buyers, I've identified the following individuals as representatives

1. People who has a driving liscense but do not have a vehicle yet.
These people have few knowledge about the things to consider since they have not gone through the vehicle purchasing process. I would like to see how my presentation can affect they decisions.

2. People who have a vehicle.
These people have already gone through the vehicle purchasing process and have insights of key aspects of driving a vehicle. I would like to see how my presentation can affect their decisions combined with all their existing knowledge.

#### c. your interview script

1. What do you think is this website used for?
2. Who might be the target audience of this website?
3. Do you think these information on the website can help you make the decision?
4. Any missing contents you are looking for while making your decisions?
5. What do you feel confusing of find missing for making decisions?
6. Anything you would change to make this website a better one?

#### d. the findings from your interviews
Below are the responses from three interviewees:

**Interviewee One:**

*1. What do you think is this website used for?*

This is a general introduction about what EV is and how EV performns compared to traditional vehicles.

This website shared some concerns, or obvious cons, about EV.

*2. Who might be the target audience of this website?*

This is not a website target at selling EV to potential customers. It’s more about a website that provide detailed information. So, the target audience should be people who are interested in EV and EV industry, not people who are considering buying an EV.

*3. Do you think this information on the website can help you make the decision?*

No. Because as a potential customer, I’ve already known that range anxiety and price are the two major defects of EV compared to traditional vehicles.

*4. Any missing contents you are looking for while making your decisions?*

Whether should we buy. Electric range and price are already in thoughts. No additional information given in this process.

*5. What do you feel confusing about this website.*

Benchmark between two vehicles. Item by item comparison.

Detailed benefits (pros, cons, quantitatively) between ICV and EV of similar price.

Financing. Whether customers can get loan, or post services.

*6. Anything you would change to make this website a better one?*

Introduce what’s the different between EV and others. For normal customers

Recommend a couple of attributes of EV, such as MPG, and provided links for interviewers

Quiz for whether a potential customer are suitable for EV such as range, house size.

**Interviewee Two**

*1. What do you think is this website used for?*

Explains the reasons why people do not purchase EVs and provides details and people’s concerns. There is a number data that talk about the cons of buying an EV.

*2. Who might be the target audience of this website?*

Industry analyst, especially those in vehicle industry. Analysts in stock market can also be the target audience.

*3. Do you think this information on the website can help you make the decision?*

Yes. This website demonstrates the major concerns which is price and electric range. 

However, the chart about geo distributions of EV owners doesn’t help with the decision-making process. It’s obvious that big cities will always have more EV owners. This chart only proves some concepts that people already are aware of.

*4. Any missing contents you are looking for while making your decisions?*

Information about EV usage. Charging station, such as map of super charging, price of electricity usage, oil saving compared to using a traditional vehicle, price of installing charging stations, etc

*5. What do you feel confusing about this website.?*

The chart about electric range is too complicated to understand at the first sight.

In the price chart, Volt and model x have similar color, which is hard to dintinguish

Do not know what ICV stands for.

*6. Anything you would change to make this website a better one?*

Present a summary at the beginning

Add some metrics to help consumers make the decision

**Interviewee Three**

*1. What do you think is this website used for?*

I’m confused. May be a presentation to the author’s boss in a consulting firm to report the current status of EV industry.

This website can also be used For EV industry market research. Could also be a website to see how this industry performs and locate potential users.

*2. Who might be the target audience of this website?*

Maybe the author’s boss in a consulting firm, or the client of the author.

Could also be used by media companies like Bloomberg as news presses.

*3. Do you think this information on the website can help you make the decision?*

Not enough. Information is too little.

*4. Any missing contents you are looking for while making your decisions?*

The contents about EV’s popularity and population provide little help in decision making process. Also, the geo distribution of EV in the Washington State is not relevant either.

What a potential buyer really cares are those concerns. Price is the biggest concern of a potential buyer. Meanwhile, I would like to know if there is any way to address price issue, like providing financing?

The chart of electric range can relieve my concerns on range anxiety.

I would like to see more comparison between EV and ICV in a variety of fields such as specifications, price, brand, etc.

In recommendations part, we can apply use cases to illustrate this point.

*5. What do you feel confusing about this website.?*

I’m a bit confused about the major intention of this website. Is this website used to persuade people to buy EVs? Or is it just an introduction material to provide object opinions?,

At the beginning, the website says that EV is good. However, the latter part said negative things about EV. It’s confusing.

It’s hard to tell the conclusion of price chart.

*6. Anything you would change to make this website a better one?*

I would like to see more comparisons on the life-time expense of EVs and traditional vehicles.
The chart at the beginning looks like marking materials. However, charts in the main contents do not look as good as the first several ones. Should put more efforts into data visualization.
