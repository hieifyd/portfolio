A final project Github page that summarizes all the work you've done thus far to create your final project.
You don't need to re-write or recreate content you've already created for parts I and II of this assignment as long as it's organized in an easy-to-follow way.
This document should serve as a kind of "behind the scenes" look at how you created your work.
When reviewing Part III of your final assignment, I should be able to clearly follow along in your progress - noting how you used everything you've created in Part I and Part II to develop your final project. 

Your final project page should include links/references to everything you've used.  Make sure that your final project page includes all of the following, at a minimum: 


## Final data story

### A few paragraphs that talk about the intended audience for your final data story. Include any personas and/or other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus.  Talk about specific things you did to your final project to make it work for your audience. 

The target audience of my final presentation is people who are considering buying a vehicle and considering an electric vehicle as an option. My intention is to inform them whether they should buy an electric vehicle or just a traditional internal combustion vehicle.

I organized my presentation in the following sequences: 

1. Use Washington State as an example to introduce the overall situation of the electric vehicle market. The key idea is electric is gaining more and more popular, but its total amount is still quite low compared to that of traditional vehicle
2. To help a normal customer to make decisions, I introduced and analyzed some concerns to put forward more detailed information which might not be known by potential customers.
3. Based on the analysis of the big picture and personal preference, I put forward my recommendation in the end.

During the whole process, I received and applied feedbacks from two in-class critique sessions and three interviews outside of class. All this feedback helped me better organize my story, polish my charts, and make the whole story more smooth. The modifications I made based on those feedbacks will be introduced in the next section.

### A few paragraphs that summarize the work you've done so far. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned to work through the process. (Part III)

**Storyboard**

Thinking in the shoe of my target audience. I assume that people who are thinking of purchasing a vehicle are familiar with terminologies and acronyms such as EV and ICV. However, it appears that it would be helpful to give more background information to help my target audience get a better idea of what the presentation is talking about.

During my interview, a couple of interviewees said they were not sure what is the key idea of my presentation. So instead of telling my story bit by bit, I decided to include a summary at the beginning to help my audience understand the contents I meant to introduce in my presentation.

From the feedback from my interviewee and in the class, I have identified some missing contents the target audience cares about, such as the comparison of life-time expenses of an electric and that of a traditional vehicle. I looked up more information and added it to my presentation.

**Data Visualization**

I chose to use some fancy charts such as scattered charts to illustrate my viewpoint. However, I received some feedback saying they didn't get the idea of those charts. Some people suggested I can use simple charts such as line charts to illustrate my point. Reflecting on those suggestions, I remembered that it is the idea I want to convey that matters the most, not how fancy the chart is. So I replaced some complex charts with bar charts or line charts.

Color is another issue mentioned by my interviewees. I've got a picture illustrating the price of different vehicle models. Some interviewees found that the colors of a couple of vehicle models are confusing. So I polished the chart to better convey my key message.

### Include a link to your updated Github repository that includes a link to your final data story (e.g. a link to your Shorthand / StoryMap or other final projects).  Make sure your data story is published and publicly accessible. (Part III)
