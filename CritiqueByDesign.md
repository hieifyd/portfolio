## Explanation on processes
I intend to demonstrate the number of estimates, the comparison among five candidates, and trends over time.
The size of the dot shows the number of estimates of each candidate. The bigger the circle is, the more estimates that the candidate has.
Y-axis represents different candidates. X-axis represents date.
The color is used to distinguish various candidates.
